			<h3> Background</h3>
			<article>My name is Thomas Nguyen Cong, and as said in the upper section, I'm studying web and app development at <a href="https://www.ingesup.com/" target="_blank">Ynov-Ingésup</a>. Before that I was studying  at the Sorbonne (Paris-1) where I got myself a Licence in management and economics. And even before that I graduated from highschool in economics with honors.<br>
			Changing path from economics to development was definitly the right choice for me since I'm having much more fun than i did while I was still learning economics, law and accounting. Also I'm better at what I do now, learning feels easier than before and I can say that I've learned how to feels to enjoy work<br>
			I've had a few real work experiences, mostly a summerjob in 2014 at the finance department of a company called Newedge group SA, as well as few internships here and there during my time in school and university.

		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>Just like everyone, I have different hobbies and interests, I enjoy sports very much and have been playing competitevely since I was very young, especially basketball, football and tennis. I also enjoy a large variety of music styles going from electronic tunes to french and belgian rap only to cite a few. I like travelling alot and even think it's an essential part of life, when I was younger i had the opportunity to go to many exciting countries all thanks to my family. Since then it's been an objective to see as much of the world as possible. </p>

				<h3 id="title-align">Web Development Skills</h3>
				<p>So far during my time learning web development, I have had the opportunity to work on many different websites (from typical bootstrap websites to jsFiddle-like pages). These web pages were school projects  and as well as personal projects,doing all this gave me a ton of experience on the basic web development languages such as <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. You can take this page as reference for what I can build using these languages alone, and if this is not enough for you please remember that I will be doing better websites as times passes.

							<p>My very first webpage and project, it was a blog about anything we wanted, not my best result but it can be used to mesure progression. This served as a way to make us test what we learned when we first started learning <Strong>HTML</Strong> and <Strong>CSS</Strong>.</p>

			<p>Building web pages is not the only thing I've learned yet, I also had to chance to work on building small applications using object oriented languages such as <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>CSharp</strong> for unity. This is the part of development had the most fun with, since it requires us to think harder in order to find one of many existing solutions to our problems. Developping a game was a break-trough experience for me and I will keep working on similar projects in the near future.</p>

							<p>This is the video game I worked as our biggest project of the year. It's a 2d game made to be played on a computer, it's a rage inducing game that can be quite unfair, but is always lots of fun. I was part of a team of 3 developpers (which had never used any game engine beforehand), 3 artists and 2 economics students. it was quite the challenge to learn how to use Unity2d and animate a tentacle well enough to make it look real, but we managed.

							Cosmo Quest is a game that was made for a Game Jam, the requirements were "confrontation between 2d and 3d world", this is a platformer developped in Unity 3d. The main game mechanic is that you can press a key to switch between dimensions. The game is still under developpment but it will definitly see the light of day sometime.
